    "question": "How does FinApp handle transaction categorization and is there a way to automate this process?",

To reduce manual entry, the system uses 'Rules' located in the Operations section. These rules automatically assign categories to imported bank transactions based on predefined conditions, such as matching text strings (e.g., 'rent') in the transaction description."

In contrast, the Profit and Loss (P&L) report is designed to show the actual financial performance and profitability. The P&L report breaks down data into Revenue, Cost of Sales, Gross Profit, and Operating Expenses to arrive at Net Profit, helping entrepreneurs understand if their business model is sustainable beyond just cash movements."
